# Predicting_House_Prices
This project aims to predict house prices using a dataset from King County, which includes Seattle. The dataset contains information on house sales between May 2014 and May 2015, with 21 columns and 21,597 rows. 
The features include various details such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition, grade, and more.
The code is a comprehensive analysis and implementation of a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on a dataset containing various features.

# Description:
This project aims to predict house prices using a dataset from King County, which includes Seattle.
The dataset contains information on house sales between May 2014 and May 2015, with 21 columns and 21,597 rows. 
The features include various details such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition, grade, and more.

# Code Structure:
**Data Loading and Exploration:**
The dataset is loaded using pandas.
Basic information about the dataset is displayed, including feature names and data types.
Initial data exploration is done to check for missing values, data types, and statistical summaries.

# Data Analysis and Visualization:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using visualizations.
Correlation matrices and box plots are used to analyze relationships between features and house prices.
Assumptions are made based on data analysis, such as feature correlation and potential feature engineering.

# Data Preprocessing:
Features like 'id', 'zipcode', and 'date' are considered for dropping.
Feature engineering is applied to extract the year and month from the 'date' column.

# Model Training:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Data normalization (scaling) is performed using MinMaxScaler.
A neural network model is created using TensorFlow's Keras API.
The model architecture includes multiple hidden layers with configurable activation functions.
The model is compiled using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Adam optimizer.
The model is trained on the training set with 400 epochs and a batch size of 128.

# Model Evaluation:
The trained model is evaluated on the test set.
Regression evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated.
Descriptive statistics of the original house prices are provided.
Visualizations compare model predictions with actual prices and display the distribution of prediction errors.

# Model Prediction:
The trained model is used to predict the price of a new house, showcasing the process of preparing and scaling input data.
Image Classification using CNN (Bonus Section):

# Image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset is demonstrated.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built using TensorFlow's Keras API.
The model is compiled and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Data augmentation is applied to improve model performance.
The accuracy of the model is visualized over epochs.
A sample image from the test set is selected, and the model predicts its label.
Questions and Interactivity:
The code includes interactive questions that encourage understanding and engagement. These questions cover topics such as the impact of batch size, the need for data normalization, the role of dropout, and understanding convolutional layers.

# Note:
The code assumes basic knowledge of machine learning concepts, neural networks, and TensorFlow/Keras.
Comments and explanations are provided throughout the code for clarity.
The code demonstrates good coding practices and documentation.
